# Fictional Garbanzo Server
This is a library server written in rust!

# Purpose
The goals of this project are
- Familiarzing myself with developing in rust
- Working on Continuous Integration and Project Management
- Developing Backend Web APIs
- Open Source project management

# How to Run the Server
You will need `rustup` installed and `cargo`. Assuming you have those,
you just need to run `cargo run`.
